          <div class="stack">
            <div class="fact"><h4>It was the highest-grossing Japanese film at the time of its 1997 release.</h4><p>Princess Mononoke held that record until Titanic arrived in Japan shortly after — and then until Spirited Away surpassed it in 2001.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Miyazaki described it as his most personal and most difficult film.</h4><p>He spent years developing the script and considers it the film where he most directly wrestled with his feelings about humanity and the natural world.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>No purely evil characters exist.</h4><p>Miyazaki insisted that Lady Eboshi, who destroys the forest, is not a villain — she's building a better society. The conflict is systemic, not moral.</p></div>

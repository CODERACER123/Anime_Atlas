          <h1>Ranking of Kings</h1>
          <p class="lead">Prince Bojji is deaf, mute, and too weak to lift a sword. The world ranks kings by power — and by every measure, he is last. His only friend is Kage, a shadow creature who teaches him to communicate. Their journey to become king, and what that word actually means, is one of anime's most devastating emotional experiences.</p>

              <li>Every "villain" has a history that made them what they are</li>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Bojji and Kage</h3><p>The storybook visual style is immediately disarming — but Bojji's isolation, the cruelty of those who mock him, and Kage's own history of loss are established with genuine emotional weight. Their friendship is the series' emotional anchor.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Kingdom's Secrets</h3><p>Bojji's stepmother Hiling and half-brother Daida reveal their full complexity — Hiling's fierce maternal love, Daida's tragic manipulation by the mirror demon Miranjo. No character in this series is simply a villain.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: The Tournament</h3><p>The ranking system that defines the series' world is revealed to be both literal and deeply flawed — the things it measures are not the things that matter. Bojji's approach to every challenge redefines what the ranking should mean.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Finale: What Makes a King</h3><p>Every character's arc converges in a finale that rejects easy resolutions — each character's goodness or cruelty is traced back to their wounds, and the series' answer to "what makes a king" is genuinely surprising and earned.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The art style deceived many viewers initially.</h4><p>The simple, rounded character designs look like a children's fairy tale — and completely misrepresent the narrative's emotional sophistication. Many viewers were blindsided by how affecting it becomes.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Bojji's sign language was developed in consultation with experts.</h4><p>The production worked to make Bojji and Kage's communication system internally consistent and emotionally expressive — it's not just hand-waving, it has actual vocabulary.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Every major antagonist receives a sympathetic backstory.</h4><p>Unlike most fantasy series, Ranking of Kings commits fully to showing why every "villain" became what they are — and allows viewers to grieve for them, not just defeat them.</p></div>

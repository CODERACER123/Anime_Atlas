          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Life in the Moving Castle</h3><p>Sophie becomes the castle's cleaning woman, joining the fire demon Calcifer, apprentice Markl, and eventually Howl himself. She discovers Howl's dangerous arrangement with Calcifer — and his reckless involvement in the war.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: War &amp; Howl's Secret</h3><p>War escalates. Howl joins the magical battles transforming himself into a monstrous bird — but each transformation risks making the change permanent. Sophie must find a way to save him before he loses himself entirely.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Finale: The Heart of the Fire</h3><p>Sophie's growing confidence — and love — drives her to broker an impossible deal involving Howl's heart and Calcifer's freedom, resolving the curse and the war through compassion rather than power.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Based on Diana Wynne Jones' beloved 1986 novel.</h4><p>Miyazaki's adaptation takes significant creative liberties — adding the war context and changing the ending — but the novel's warmth and wit remain central.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The castle's design took years to develop.</h4><p>The mechanical, lurching, multi-directional castle was a huge technical challenge for Studio Ghibli — blending hand-drawn and early CG animation seamlessly.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Miyazaki made the film during the Iraq War.</h4><p>The war backdrop is largely his addition, and he's spoken openly about making it as a response to the geopolitics of the early 2000s.</p></div>

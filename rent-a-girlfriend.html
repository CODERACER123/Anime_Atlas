When his grandmother has a health scare, Kazuya introduces her as his real girlfriend. Then he can't undo it. For three seasons running.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The Lie Takes Root</h3><p>What starts as a one-time rental spin completely out of control. Kazuya's grandmother, his ex Mami, and eventually Chizuru's own grandmother get involved — each creating new pressure to maintain the fiction.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Rental Rivals</h3><p>Sumi (shy, aspiring rental girlfriend) and Ruka (aggressive, has genuinely fallen for Kazuya) complicate the dynamic further. Each girl has her own reasons for what she does with the rental service and with Kazuya specifically.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Chizuru's Dream</h3><p>Chizuru's real goal — becoming an actress — becomes central as Kazuya, recognising her talent, begins actively helping her pursue it. The series' emotional core shifts from romantic comedy to something about supporting someone else's ambition.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Where the Lie Ends</h3><p>The accumulated weight of the pretense gradually forces both Kazuya and Chizuru toward honesty — separately first, then with each other. The slow-burn pay-off is the series' endgame.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Kazuya is one of manga's most debated protagonists.</h4><p>No modern romance protagonist generates more heated reader opinion — his indecisiveness and self-sabotage are either realistic depictions of emotional immaturity or simply infuriating, depending on who you ask.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Chizuru's acting subplot gives the series unexpected depth.</h4><p>The rental girlfriend premise is essentially a cover for a story about a woman whose real passion is suppressed by financial necessity — and a man who comes to understand and champion it.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The manga has run over 300 chapters in Weekly Shonen Magazine.</h4><p>Despite constant "will they / won't they" critique, the manga has maintained enormous readership, suggesting the tension itself is the product rather than the obstacle.</p></div>

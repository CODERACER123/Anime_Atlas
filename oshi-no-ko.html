            <div class="fact"><h4>The 90-minute premiere broke streaming records.</h4><p>HIDIVE and other platforms reported record view counts for the extended first episode — the shocking ending of the prologue spread virally immediately after release.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Written by Aka Akasaka (Kaguya-sama) and art by Mengo Yokoyari (Scum's Wish).</h4><p>The collaboration combines Akasaka's twisty, comedic romance plotting with Yokoyari's darker emotional sensibility — resulting in a manga unlike either of their solo works.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The series is a searing critique of Japan's idol culture.</h4><p>The "lie as performance" theme directly engages with the constructed personas, parasocial relationships, and fan violence inherent to idol fandoms.</p></div>

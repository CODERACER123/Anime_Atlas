          <p class="lead">As a child, Shoya Ishida bullied Shoko Nishimiya — a deaf girl — until she transferred schools. Years later, haunted by guilt and a social outcast himself, he seeks her out not for absolution, but because she deserves an apology he may not deserve to give.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The Bullying</h3><p>Elementary school. Shoko transfers in — deaf, armed with a notebook, trying her hardest. Shoya leads the class in making her life miserable, breaking seven hearing aids. When it goes too far, the class turns on Shoya to avoid blame.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Carrying the Weight</h3><p>Years later, Shoya is in high school and completely isolated — he has mentally X'd out every face around him. He has been learning sign language and tracks Shoko down, not sure what he even wants to say.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Rebuilding</h3><p>The two rebuild a careful, tentative friendship, joined by a group of characters each carrying their own forms of guilt, loneliness, and unsaid truths. Nothing is simple or quickly resolved.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Finale: The Bridge</h3><p>A crisis forces everyone to face what they've been avoiding. The final act is devastating and then, slowly, genuinely hopeful — built on real change rather than easy forgiveness.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Directed by Naoko Yamada at Kyoto Animation.</h4><p>Yamada's direction focuses intimately on hands, feet, and non-verbal communication — a deliberate visual language for a story about connection without words.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The film is widely praised by the deaf community.</h4><p>The depiction of Shoko's experience — including imperfect sign language and the social complications of deafness — was reviewed as unusually nuanced and respectful.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The X's over faces are a carefully designed visual metaphor.</h4><p>Shoya sees everyone's face obscured by an X — his inability to engage with others made literal. When they fade, it signals real psychological change.</p></div>

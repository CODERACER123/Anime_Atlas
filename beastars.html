          <h1>Beastars</h1>
          <p class="lead">In a world of anthropomorphic animals, the eating of other animals is strictly taboo — but instinct and society's rules are in permanent, unresolved tension. Grey wolf Legoshi is large, terrifying-looking, and gently non-violent. When a classmate is devoured in the school theatre, the question of who — and why — exposes the fault lines running through everyone.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The Devouring</h3><p>The murder of alpaca student Tem destabilises the Cherryton High drama club. Legoshi, a wolf who has suppressed his predatory instincts his entire life, becomes a suspect — and simultaneously falls for dwarf rabbit Haru, putting both his self-control and his understanding of himself under extreme pressure.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Black Market</h3><p>Beneath the school's herbivore-carnivore peace is a criminal underworld where meat is sold illegally. Legoshi's investigation takes him into this world — and toward a confrontation with the Beastar (the ideal of what an animal can be) that school president Louis is working furiously to become.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Louis and the Lions</h3><p>Louis, a red deer being groomed for greatness, makes choices that place him in the lion mafia — and reveal the performances of power that underlie the entire social fabric. His arc is about what it costs a prey animal to survive in a world that respects only predators.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Season 2: Melon</h3><p>The second season introduces Melon — a hybrid carnivore/herbivore who represents the failure of both worlds' ideals — and escalates into a conflict about what society does with those it cannot categorise. Darker and more ambitious than season one.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The anime uses 3DCG animation from Studio Orange.</h4><p>Studio Orange (Land of the Lustrous) applied their signature photorealistic CG style to Beastars — the fur rendering was widely praised as a technical achievement.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The manga won the Manga Taishou Award in 2018.</h4><p>Paru Itagaki's work was commercially and critically successful before the anime — she is the daughter of Baki creator Keisuke Itagaki, and the contrast in their styles is frequently discussed.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The series is widely read as a racism and class anxiety allegory.</h4><p>The herbivore/carnivore divide maps onto multiple real-world discriminations — structural disadvantage, profiling, and the violence of civility enforced on those whose existence is considered inherently threatening.</p></div>

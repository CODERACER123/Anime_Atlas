          <p class="lead">Rintaro attends an all-boys school and has always looked down on the girls' school next door — until he meets Kaoruko, the most elegant and composed girl he's ever seen. The problem: their schools are fierce rivals, and his first impression of her was terrible.</p>

Kaoruko is the pride of Kikyo Girls' High, and Rintaro represents the rival Ouka Boys' school — their worlds are not supposed to intersect.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Drawn Together Anyway</h3><p>Circumstances keep throwing them into each other's paths. Rintaro discovers that behind Kaoruko's composed exterior is a genuine, warm person who doesn't know how to be understood. He finds himself wanting to be the one who understands her.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Navigating the Rivalry</h3><p>Their growing closeness becomes a point of friction with school culture, friends, and family expectations. Both must decide how much they're willing to push back against the world they've always lived in.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Slow Burn, Warm Payoff</h3><p>The manga is praised for its careful pacing — scenes between Rintaro and Kaoruko are charged with unspoken feeling and genuine chemistry that rewards patient readers and viewers.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Kaoruko is notable as a shojo-leaning lead in a seinen manga.</h4><p>Her composure, interiority, and the care given to her perspective make the manga feel atypical for its demographic — closer to shojo in emotional focus.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The manga gained a large fanbase rapidly after serialisation.</h4><p>Strong word-of-mouth and excellent character writing propelled it to popularity before the anime announcement accelerated its reach.</p></div>

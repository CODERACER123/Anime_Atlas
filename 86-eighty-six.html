          <p class="lead">The Republic of San Magnolia claims its war is fought entirely by unmanned weapons with no casualties. The truth: the pilots are children of the "86th District" — a persecuted ethnic minority stripped of citizenship, piloting mechs to their deaths beyond the wall, hidden from the public eye.</p>

She is horrified by their conditions. They are used to people like her being horrified and doing nothing.</p></article>

His relationship with Lena, conducted only through radio, gradually reveals both characters' full humanity.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>One of the most acclaimed anime of 2021.</h4><p>86 received near-universal praise for its thematic depth, A-1 Pictures' production values, and its willingness to confront discrimination as its central subject rather than a backdrop.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The original light novel was written by Asato Asato.</h4><p>A rare case of a major light novel authored by a woman, dealing with serious political themes — it ran from 2017 and has collected multiple major light novel awards.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The split-cour broadcast created enormous anticipation.</h4><p>A long, unexplained delay between Season 1's first and second halves became one of 2021's most discussed phenomena — partly due to production challenges that A-1 Pictures acknowledged.</p></div>

          <h1>Pick Me Up! Infinite Gacha</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Betrayed and abandoned at the bottom of a dungeon, a young adventurer named Raito discovers his unique skill: Infinite Gacha — an ability that lets him pull SSR-rank companions without limit. What starts as survival quickly becomes a systematic dismantling of everyone who wronged him.

            <h3>Raito</h3>
            <p>Left for dead in a dungeon by his own party, Raito's supposedly weak Infinite Gacha skill reveals its true broken potential. Over years alone in the dungeon, he raises an entire civilization of summoned companions — becoming far more powerful than those who abandoned him could ever imagine.</p>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>The Infinite Gacha Skill</h3>
            <p>Unlike standard gacha, Raito's skill has no limit — he can pull endlessly, always getting SSR-rank cards. Each card summons a unique individual with their own personality and abilities, all loyal to Raito. The result is less a hero and more a one-man nation-state.</p>

            <h3>The SSR Companions</h3>
            <p>Characters like Mei (the automaton), Dark Elf archers, and S-rank warriors fill Raito's party. Unlike disposable power-fantasy fodder, the companions have distinct personalities and relationships with Raito, giving the series a found-family warmth beneath its revenge premise.</p>

            <h3>The Revenge Arc</h3>
            <p>Raito's former party members went on to become famous heroes — completely unaware he survived. When their paths eventually cross, the gap between what they think he is and what he has actually become makes for some of isekai's most satisfying confrontations.</p>

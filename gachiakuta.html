          <h1>Gachiakuta</h1>
          <p class="lead">In a floating city, the poor live on the outskirts and the rich in the centre — and those who break the rules are "discarded," thrown into the Pit below. When Rudo is framed for his guardian's murder and thrown down, he discovers the Pit is full of trash monsters, survivors, and a power called "Enkindling" that lets you weaponise discarded objects. He wants one thing: to go back up and make those responsible pay.</p>

              <li>The literal disposal of the poor — out of sight, out of mind</li>
              <li>Trash as identity — "discarded" people fighting with discarded things</li>
              <li>Rage as fuel that can become either destruction or purpose</li>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The Fall</h3><p>Rudo's life as an outer-city scavenger ends when he witnesses something he shouldn't — and is thrown into the Pit. His survival down there depends on learning fast: what the monsters want, who the other survivors are, and how Enkindling works.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Cleaners</h3><p>The Pit has its own community of survivors called Cleaners — people who use Enkindling to fight the monsters made of animated refuse. Their leader Regto has his own agenda, and Rudo's rage makes him valuable but unpredictable.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: The Truth of the Pit</h3><p>The origin of the Pit — why it exists, what it serves, and why the city above pretends it doesn't — is not what any survivor believes. The conspiracy connecting the floating city's ruling class to the monster ecology below is systematic and deliberate.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: The Way Back Up</h3><p>Rudo's goal remains fixed — get back to the city above, find the person who framed him, and expose everything. His combat ability grows as his understanding of what Enkindling truly is deepens — and so does his understanding of what he'd be returning to.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Created by Ryuhei Tamura, who also made Beelzebub.</h4><p>Tamura's earlier Shonen Jump series Beelzebub (2009) was a demon-baby comedy action manga — Gachiakuta is a significant tonal departure, darker and more politically pointed.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The Enkindling power system is built around objects with emotional history.</h4><p>Weapons made from discarded objects absorb the feelings of those who used and discarded them — the power system is directly tied to the thematic content about what we throw away.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The anime adaptation debuted in 2024.</h4><p>The anime premiered as part of the summer 2024 season, produced by Bones — the studio behind My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and Mob Psycho 100.</p></article></p></div>

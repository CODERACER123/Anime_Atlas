          <h1>Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian</h1>
          <p class="lead">Half-Russian transfer student Alisa "Alya" Mikhailova is the school's untouchable ice queen — except she whispers affectionate things in Russian to the boy beside her, Masachika Kuze, because she's certain he can't understand. He's been studying Russian in secret for years. He says nothing.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The Whispers Begin</h3><p>Alya dismisses most people and treats Masachika as beneath her notice — while confiding her real thoughts about him to the air in Russian. Masachika, understanding every word, responds to her dismissals in a way that inexplicably stings her.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Student Council Campaign</h3><p>Alya runs for student council president — and drags a reluctant Masachika into the campaign. The political competition forces them into proximity and collaboration, and reveals Masachika is considerably more capable than he lets on.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Masachika's Past</h3><p>Masachika's apparent laziness conceals a deliberate choice to step back from a previous life of high achievement — and a complicated relationship with his own family history involving his sister Yuki, who is also running for student council.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Closing the Distance</h3><p>As Alya's Russian confessions become less careful and Masachika's understanding becomes harder to hide, both characters circle toward an honest conversation they are not yet ready to have.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The Russian dialogue is accurately translated in the subtitles.</h4><p>The anime does not hand-wave the Russian — Alya's lines are genuine Russian phrases, and the comedic tension relies on viewers knowing she's saying exactly what the subtitles say while believing Masachika can't.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Alya became a beloved character design almost immediately.</h4><p>The half-Russian visual design — silver hair, heterochromatic-adjacent colouring — combined with the tsundere-but-oblivious personality generated significant fan art and merchandise before the anime even aired.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The light novel is published by Kadokawa's Dengeki Bunko imprint.</h4><p>Written by Sunsunsun with art by Momoco, the light novel began in 2021 and was adapted by Doga Kobo — a studio known for character-focused romantic comedies — in 2024.</p></div>

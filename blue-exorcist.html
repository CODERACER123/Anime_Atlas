          <h1>Blue Exorcist</h1>
          <p class="lead">Rin Okumura has always been troublesome, hot-tempered, and oddly strong. When he manifests blue flames and learns he is the son of Satan, raised by the kind exorcist Father Fujimoto, he makes a choice: he will become an exorcist and defeat his own father. Training at True Cross Academy — where his twin Yukio already teaches — is the first step.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Awakening and Loss</h3><p>Rin's blue flames manifest in a demonic attack, and, crucially, Father Fujimoto — his guardian, mentor, and the only father he's known — dies trying to protect him. The grief and guilt of that loss drives Rin's determination throughout the series.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: True Cross Academy</h3><p>Rin enrols in the exorcist training division of True Cross Academy, where his brother Yukio is already a qualified teacher. Their dynamic — Rin's chaotic power vs. Yukio's controlled perfectionism — is the series' central tension.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: The Order's Suspicion</h3><p>The True Cross Order knows what Rin is. Some want to use him; some want to kill him. His classmates discover his heritage — and their varied responses define who he can trust. The politics of the exorcist world are not clean.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Yukio's Darkness</h3><p>Later arcs focus increasingly on Yukio — who discovers he also carries Satan's blood, differently — and the series' most complex question: what happens when the person committed to fighting evil begins to understand its appeal?</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The original anime diverged from the manga in Season 1's finale.</h4><p>The 2011 A-1 Pictures anime caught up to the manga and created an original ending. The 2017 series Kyoto Saga and subsequent seasons return to the manga's storyline, effectively ignoring the 2011 finale.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Yukio's arc became more prominent than expected.</h4><p>In the manga, Yukio's internal conflict — struggling with the same satanic power he's spent his life denying — became the series' most discussed storyline, rivalling Rin's as the emotional core.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Rin's weapon, Kurikara, seals his demon form.</h4><p>The katana sealing Rin's power belongs to Father Fujimoto — making it both the safeguard against his worst self and a direct link to the mentor he lost and is trying to honour.</p></div>

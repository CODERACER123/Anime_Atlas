          <p class="lead">Issei Hyodo, a pervy high schooler, is killed on his first date by a fallen angel. He's resurrected as a devil by third-year student and devil heiress Rias Gremory, joining her peerage. Now caught in the three-way war between devils, angels, and fallen angels, Issei's dream of a harem gets extremely complicated — and his Sacred Gear "Boosted Gear" turns out to be genuinely world-threatening.</p>

        <div class="grid two">
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Joining the Peerage</h3><p>Issei joins Rias Gremory's devil peerage — a chess-piece-based power structure where Rias is King and her pieces are her allies. His first missions establish the Rating Game system (devil duels) and the political drama between devil noble houses.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Fallen Angel Conspiracy</h3><p>The fallen angel organisation Grigori, led by Kokabiel, moves toward open war. The three-faction balance is genuinely fragile, and Issei's Boosted Gear — which doubles his power every ten seconds — turns out to have a history that predates him significantly.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Rating Games</h3><p>The structured devil-on-devil battles become a platform for Issei's growth — he's at a massive disadvantage in power, and must improvise tactically and develop his Sacred Gear in ways no previous user managed.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Later Seasons: The Hero Faction</h3><p>Human organisation the Hero Faction, led by Cao Cao wielding the True Longinus, introduces a genuinely threatening antagonist — and the series escalates from devil politics to a conflict that involves every supernatural faction simultaneously.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Boosted Gear is among the most power-escalating abilities in any series.</h4><p>The "double every ten seconds" mechanic — if Issei can survive long enough — theoretically allows him to surpass any opponent regardless of starting power gap. The series treats this seriously.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The light novel series has 25 main volumes.</h4><p>Ichiei Ishibumi's light novels ran from 2008 to 2018, with several spin-off series continuing — the anime covered roughly the first 10 volumes across four seasons.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Rias Gremory became one of the most recognised character designs of her era.</h4><p>The crimson-haired devil heiress became a reference point for "powerful beautiful woman who is also genuinely kind" character archetypes in early 2010s anime.</p></div>

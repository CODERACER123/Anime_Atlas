          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Rio in the Slums</h3><p>Rio's early life in poverty ends when he accidentally witnesses a kidnapping and saves a noble girl — earning both royal favour and dangerous enemies among the nobility. Haruto's memories surface, bringing new emotional context to all of it.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Royal Academy</h3><p>Rio is granted entry to a prestigious royal academy — where he's treated with contempt as a commoner among nobles. His combat ability and spirit arts talent gradually command reluctant respect.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Spirit Village</h3><p>Rio encounters a hidden village of spirit folk — people with extraordinary magic who live away from human kingdoms. Their lifestyle and community give him something he has never had: belonging.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Converging Fates</h3><p>Haruto's former relationships and unresolved binds from his previous life begin intersecting with Rio's journey — suggesting the two lives were not fused by accident but by something deliberate.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The dual-consciousness premise sets it apart from standard isekai.</h4><p>Rather than a simple reincarnation, Rio retains his original identity while Haruto's memories layer on top — creating a genuine identity crisis rather than just a "transported person with modern knowledge" setup.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>A second season continues the story.</h4><p>Spirit Chronicles received additional anime content through OVAs and a second season, expanding on the spirit village arc and Haruto's former connections appearing in this world.</p></div>

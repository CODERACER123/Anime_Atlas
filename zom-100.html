          <h1>Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead</h1>
          <p class="lead">Akira Tendo spent three years in a soul-destroying job — unpaid overtime, toxic management, zero personal time. Then zombies take over Japan and he experiences pure joy for the first time in years: he doesn't have to go to work. He writes a bucket list of 100 things to do before he becomes a zombie. The apocalypse is the best thing that ever happened to him.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The List Begins</h3><p>The first episode establishes Akira's pre-zombie life — genuinely harrowing corporate abuse — before the zombies arrive. His joy is not a joke; it is earned. The bucket list items range from silly to meaningful, and the series commits to all of them.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Kencho and Shizuka</h3><p>Akira meets old friend Kencho and survival-focused Shizuka, whose entirely different approach to the apocalypse — treating it as a crisis to managed efficiently rather than a windfall of freedom — creates productive friction.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Survivor Communities</h3><p>The group encounters different communities of survivors — each with their own philosophy of how to live in the new world. Some have rebuilt old hierarchies. Some have created new ones. None are as simple as they appear.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: The Nature of Living</h3><p>The bucket list slowly transforms from escapism to genuine self-exploration — each item Akira completes tells him something about who he was before, and who he wants to be now that nobody is forcing him to be anything.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The series is an explicit critique of Japan's overwork culture.</h4><p>The manga by Haro Aso and Kotaro Takata opens with Akira's working conditions described in the language of horror — deliberately framing the corporate world as the real zombie situation.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>BUG FILMS produced the anime in 2023 with distinctive vivid colour.</h4><p>The anime's saturated, pop-art visual palette was a deliberate choice — the contrast between bright visuals and zombie carnage reinforces the series' life-affirmation tone.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Shizuka's arc deconstructs the "survival-first" mentality.</h4><p>Her character is designed to challenge Akira's approach — not because she's wrong about survival, but because the series wants to examine what surviving without living actually means.</p></div>

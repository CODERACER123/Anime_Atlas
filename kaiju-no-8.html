          <h1>Kaiju No. 8</h1>
          <p class="lead">Kafka Hibino has failed the Defence Force entrance exam twice and now spends his days cleaning up kaiju corpses. After being infected by a small kaiju, he gains the ability to transform into an impossibly powerful monster himself — Kaiju No. 8 — while remaining human inside. Now he must hide his power from the very force he's trying to join.</p>

He joins the Third Division under the legendary Mina Ashiro — the woman he promised to fight alongside as a child.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Kaiju No. 9</h3><p>An intelligent kaiju begins appearing — capable of strategy, stealing Daiskaiju parts to augment itself, and targeting specific Defence Force members. It has an interest in Kafka's transformation that goes beyond coincidence.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: The Secret Exposed</h3><p>Kafka's transformation is eventually witnessed by colleagues. The question shifts from "will he be discovered" to "what does it mean that a human can become a kaiju without losing himself — and what does the Defence Force do with that?"</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: War Escalation</h3><p>The kaiju threat escalates dramatically as humanoid kaiju appear in increasing numbers. Kafka and his division are at the centre of a conflict that may require redefining what humanity's relationship with kaiju actually means.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Kafka is 32 — a rare adult protagonist in shonen action.</h4><p>His age is deliberately central to the story. The series explicitly engages with what it means to pursue a dream when you're well past the "age when you should have given up."</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Production I.G animated the TV series (2024).</h4><p>Known for Ghost in the Shell, Haikyuu!!, and Attack on Titan, Production I.G's involvement raised the anime's production profile significantly before a single episode aired.</p></div>

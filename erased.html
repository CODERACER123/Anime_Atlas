When his mother is stabbed at home and he's framed for it, Revival kicks in — but sends him back eighteen years instead of minutes.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: 1988 — Protecting Kayo</h3><p>Now in his 11-year-old body with his adult mind, Satoru focuses on Kayo Hinazuki — the first child victim and the girl he barely knew. By befriending and protecting her, he hopes to break the entire chain of murders.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: The Killer's Identity</h3><p>Satoru begins to close in on the killer — someone embedded in the community, trusted by children. The show builds genuine dread as the killer seems always one step ahead.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Finale: Memory, Waking, and Justice</h3><p>The final confrontation requires Satoru to lose everything — his time, his memory, his years — before the truth can be put into the light. The ending is quiet, earned, and bittersweet.</p></article>

          <h1>World Trigger</h1>
          <p class="lead">Four years ago a dimensional gate opened above Mikado City and Neighbors — beings from other worlds — began invading. The Border defence organisation protects Japan using Trigger weapons powered by Trion, a biological energy. New recruit Osamu Mikumo is weaker than almost every agent — but his alliance with Neighbor boy Yuma changes everything about how both sides understand each other.</p>

              <li>Tactics over raw power — intelligence as the strongest Trigger</li>
              <li>"Neighbors" as people, not monsters — the other side has its own logic</li>
              <li>Institutional structures: Border's ranks, politics, and how good people navigate them</li>

        <div class="grid two">
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Yuma and Osamu</h3><p>Osamu's defining trait — choosing to act even knowing he'll lose — attracts Yuma Kuga, a Neighbor with a Black Trigger (a uniquely powerful, technically illegal weapon) who becomes his partner. Their unit is formed: Tamakoma Second.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Large-Scale Invasion</h3><p>A massive coordinated Neighbor attack on Mikado City reveals that invaders have strategic intelligence and specific objectives — they're not random. Border barely holds. Osamu's inability to protect people he cares about in this arc becomes a core character wound.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Rank Wars</h3><p>Border's internal ranking system — four-team Rank Wars matches — forms the series' sports-anime backbone. Tamakoma Second is at the bottom and needs to climb. Each match is a tactical puzzle; preparation and analysis are as important as the combat itself.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Away Mission</h3><p>The goal becomes joining a Border expedition into Neighbor space to find the force responsible for the attacks — and potentially the Neighbors who have abducted Mikado City residents. The political and personal stakes converge.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>World Trigger is exceptionally detailed in its tactical writing.</h4><p>Daisuke Ashihara's manga is unusual for action shonen in that it shows characters preparing for fights, analysing opponents' Trigger loadouts, and adjusting strategies — the battles are won before they start.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The manga went on hiatus multiple times due to the author's health.</h4><p>Ashihara has been transparent about health challenges affecting the serialisation — the manga's fans are notably patient and supportive, aware of the reason behind gaps.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Three seasons of anime exist, each improving in quality.</h4><p>The original 73-episode run (2014–2016) had pacing and production issues. Seasons 2 and 3 (2021–2022, 12 episodes each) were widely considered significant improvements in adaptation quality.</p></div>

          <h1>Ao Ashi</h1>
          <p class="lead">Ashito Aoi is a raw, instinct-driven footballer from Ehime Province who gets one shot at a Tokyo youth academy trial. His talent is undeniable — but the professional game demands intelligence, teamwork, and tactical understanding that no amount of raw instinct can substitute.</p>

His physical ability is exceptional but his tactical awareness is non-existent — Fukuda sees the player he could become, not who he is.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Academy Life</h3><p>Ashito joins the Esperion U-16 team and immediately struggles. He must learn positional play, communication, reading the game, and working within a system — all things instinct alone cannot teach.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Position Conversion</h3><p>Coach Fukuda suggests converting Ashito from forward to full-back — a position that demands perfect spatial awareness and defensive responsibility. Ashito is resistant, then transformed by the change.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: Road to the Top Team</h3><p>Ashito's growth as a full-back with a forward's instincts creates a unique playing style that scouts and coaches take note of. The long road to a professional contract begins in earnest.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>Ashito's position change is central to the series' identity.</h4><p>The full-back conversion is unusual in sports manga — rather than making the hero a spectacular forward, the series explores a less glamorous but equally crucial role.</p></div>

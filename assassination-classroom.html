          <p class="lead">A tentacled creature destroys part of the moon and announces he will do the same to Earth — but first, he'll teach Class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Junior High. His students have one year to kill him, or Earth is destroyed. The catch: he's the best teacher any of them have ever had.</p>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Meet Korosensei</h3><p>Class 3-E — the school's "end class," treated as failures — receives a yellow, tentacled teacher who can move at Mach 20. He's warm, insightful, and genuinely invested in each student's growth. Their assassination attempts grow increasingly creative.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Class Finds Their Feet</h3><p>Under Korosensei's teaching, the students of Class E begin to excel — academically, personally, and in their assassination techniques. They start to resent the school system that labeled them failures more than they resent their target.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Rivals and Government Agents</h3><p>Professional assassins, rival teachers with dark methods, and a government desperate for results all enter the picture. The class must defend their teacher as much as they plot to kill him.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Finale: The Truth Behind Korosensei</h3><p>The origin of Korosensei — who he was before the tentacles — is revealed in one of anime's most emotionally devastating backstory arcs. The final act is heartbreaking and earned.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The series is a sharp satire of Japan's education system.</h4><p>The stratification of students into "elite" and "end" classes mirrors real issues in competitive Japanese schooling — the series critiques this without preaching.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Karma Akabane became a fan-favourite immediately.</h4><p>The class's most violent and intelligent student struck readers and viewers as a morally complex breakout character from his very first appearance.</p></div>

          <h1>Toilet-bound Hanako-kun</h1>
          <p class="lead">Nene Yashiro summons Hanako of the toilet — the most famous of Kamome Academy's Seven Mysteries — hoping for a wish. Instead she becomes his assistant, bound to help regulate the supernaturals haunting the school. The Mysteries are real, layered, dangerous, and concealing histories darker than their cute appearances suggest.</p>

              <li>The weight of things done in the past that cannot be undone</li>
              <li>Mortality and the futures that were taken before they could exist</li>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: Hanako and Nene</h3><p>Nene's wish goes sideways and she becomes a half-fish supernatural entity, bound to Hanako. Their dynamic — his cheerful evasiveness masking something deeply guilty; her earnestness gradually sharpening into something more aware — drives the series.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: The Seven Mysteries</h3><p>Each of Kamome's Seven Mysteries is introduced — the Picture Perfect Mirai, the Mermaid of the Drowned, the Confession Tree. Each has its own internal rules, its own history, and its own way of being dangerous. Hanako oversees and regulates them all.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: Tsukasa</h3><p>Hanako's twin brother Tsukasa is introduced — cheerful, loving, and purely malevolent. His goal is to make Hanako happy, which he defines in a way that requires destroying the boundary between the living and the dead. He is one of anime's most effective recent villains.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Ongoing: What Nene Sees</h3><p>Nene's prophesied "short life" becomes a recurring shadow. As she learns more about Hanako's past — what he did and why his ghost is bound here — her understanding of what she wants her remaining time to mean deepens considerably.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The art style is influenced by Japanese woodblock printing.</h4><p>Aidairo's manga has a distinctive flat, Ukiyo-e-adjacent visual style — the anime adaptation by Lerche translated this into a bright, patterned visual aesthetic unlike any other series airing at the time (2020).</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Hanako's real name and past are a slow-reveal central mystery.</h4><p>The series withholds key biographical details about who Hanako was and exactly what he did — doling them out carefully across arcs to maintain emotional impact when the full picture emerges.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The manga continues beyond the anime's one season.</h4><p>Only one season of anime has been produced — covering the early arcs. The manga has continued significantly past what the anime covered, with growing complexity in the twin dynamic and the school's supernatural politics.</p></div>

          <article class="card"><h3>Act 1: The Diary Is Found</h3><p>The unnamed narrator finds Sakura's personal diary — titled "Living with Dying" — in a hospital waiting room. When she catches him reading it, rather than panicking, she decides to keep him close. He becomes both her confidant and her companion.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 2: Learning to Live</h3><p>Sakura drags her reluctant companion into trips, restaurants, and experiences — determined to live richly despite her prognosis. He begins to change in ways neither of them expected, gradually learning what it means to genuinely want another person in his world.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Act 3: What Living Together Means</h3><p>The friendship deepens beyond either character's defences. The tension between his emotional detachment and her warm, determined vitality becomes the emotional centre of the film.</p></article>
          <article class="card"><h3>Finale: The Ending Nobody Expected</h3><p>The film upends audience expectations about how Sakura's story ends — and then, in the aftermath, forces the narrator and the audience to reckon with the meaning of everything that came before.</p></article>

            <div class="fact"><h4>The title comes from an ancient belief about eating organs.</h4><p>In Japanese folk tradition, eating a sick person's corresponding organ would cure that illness — and it carries a deeper emotional meaning in the film's finale.</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>Based on a light novel that became a bestseller.</h4><p>Yoru Sumino's debut novel sold over 3 million copies in Japan and was adapted into both this anime film (2018) and a live-action film (2017).</p></div>
            <div class="fact"><h4>The narrator has no given name throughout.</h4><p>He's referred to only by Sakura's pet names for him ("Shiga-kun," "Haruki") or simply as "the boy" — a deliberate authorial choice about identity and connection.</p></div>

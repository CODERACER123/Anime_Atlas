          <p class="lead">
            Kim Dokja is the sole person to have read a web novel called "Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse" to its final chapter. When the story begins happening in real life, his knowledge of every plot point, character, and outcome becomes the only weapon that matters.

          <h2>The only reader who finished the story</h2>
          <p>ORV is about what it means to know the ending — and choosing to fight anyway.</p>

            <h3>Kim Dokja</h3>
            <p>An unremarkable office worker who spent years reading a novel nobody else cared about. When that novel becomes reality, his complete knowledge of the plot makes him invaluable — but also dangerously aware of who is supposed to die, including himself.</p>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Yoo Joonghyuk</h3>
            <p>The novel's original protagonist — a hyper-competent, cold regression hero who has cleared the apocalypse multiple times across timelines. His dynamic with Dokja forms the spine of the story: two people who understand the world's worst truths and choose entirely different responses.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>The Constellations</h3>
            <p>Powerful transcendent beings watch humanity struggle through apocalyptic scenarios as entertainment. They sponsor favored humans, granting power in exchange for dramatic spectacle. ORV weaponizes this concept to explore themes of narrative, observation, and what it costs to be a character in someone else's story.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>Why It's Special</h3>
            <p>ORV started as a web novel (it's a manhwa adaptation) and its literary DNA shows — the prose interiority, the tragic character arcs, the payoff of long-running foreshadowing. It treats its readers as active participants in a story about reading itself.</p>
